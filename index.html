     <h2>The book or the movie? (Percy Jackson edition)</h2>
      <p>In this editin ooooffff Which one is better: the book or the movie?I will be comparing Percy Jackson: The lighting thief novel to the movie.
       For those who have not read or heard of Percy Jackson it's a book/movie based on greek methology. It's really great book and movie that I recommend watching.
       Now if you decided to take my recoomendation and decide to inquire about Percy Jackson, you might be wondering what you should do first,  Watch the movie or read the book.
       Today I shall help you make this decision. So to begin with the book shows the thoughts of the main character unlike the movie which just shows his actions.
       So let's say you're milly joe bob oscar the 12th and you were watching the movie and ever wondered "WHAT WAS HE THINKING??" Just pause the movie go on amazon order the book wait for 2 weeks because its totally worth delaying you watching the movie for 2 weeks just to see what he was thinking. Absolutely worth it...End of part 1

    <h2>The book oooorr the movie?Part 2</h2>
    <p>2 weeks later......
    So now Milly Joe bob oscar the 12th has finally gotten his book. He starts flipping through the pages reading some random pages he comes across and after a few minutes finally finds the thought he was looking for.
    Milly Joe bob Oscar the 12th is now happy and satisfied about finally finding out what the thought was. Delighted he goes back to the movie theater and starts rewatching the movie.
    About 1/12 through the movie, Milly joe bob realises that he read a little too much in the book and now he know everything that is going to happen in the movie.
    He starts yapping about what he had read in the book to the 200 people around and spoils the movie for every single one of htem. Now they are all mad at Milly Joe Bob the 12th.
    OH, NOOO WHAT IS HE EVER GOING TO DO???? OF COURSE HE JUST PUTS THE JETS ON AND STARTS SPRINTING OUT OF THERE WITH AROUNDDD 198 PEOPLE CHASING HIM. THe other 2 out of the 200 were grandparents sooo couldnt really run but they watched on as milly joe bob ran from side to side with all of them chasing him. At least that made up for the movie they couldnt really watch anymore as they knew what would happen in there.
